# Text-Analytics NGO Review
This case study is based on the descriptions provided by different NGOs working in Africa. We look at the words used and a personâ€™s preference and provide a suggestion for an NGO to donate to. 
For this case, the NGOs we will be considering are:
-	Water to Thrive
-	H20 for Life
-	John Dau Foundation
-	African Childrens Haven
-	Africa Classroom Connection
 My model aims to advise the user on the projects they would be willing to be a part of depending on their preferences.
